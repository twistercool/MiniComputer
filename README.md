# MiniComputer
This project's purpose if for me to implement an emulator for a very low level computer, down to the truth tables of logic gates.
It will emulate circuitry that can apply simple arithmetic operations to inputs, so this project will emulate a simple ALU. Depending on where this project goes, I could makes it emulate a very (very) simple microprocessor (as in early 40's/50's, not complex silicon based processors).
Currently, I'm implementing the process that lets different circuits (consisting of emulated logic gates) use each other's outputs as inputs.
This project is not about making efficient emulation, it's about building a simple computer from scratch.
